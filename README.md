# RacewiseClassificationOfPoliceKillingData
# Summary

Many people are protesting and marching together after George Floyd's murder by the police force and some people are demanding reform and defunding the police force. So, it is one of the country's growing concerns because people are dividing in favor of him and against him. I am not on either side of them and will work as a neutral person. Furthermore, I will use machine learning algorithms to classify the death of people based on their race. My primary concern is classifying the race of victims based on age, gender, threat level, armed and mental illness, and finding the bias between white class people and black class people.
In addition, Initially, I will start this project implementing exploratory data analysis and will end implementing multiple machine learning algorithms to find the best model performance and parameters.
